# CuriosityCam

CuriosityCam is a web app that fetches photos taken by the NASA Mars rover Curiosity from the [NASA Mars Rover Photos REST API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

Visit CuriosityCam [here](https://caritaroti.github.io/).

### Current to do list:

- Error handling on API connection and data fetching
- UI fine tuning on accordion elements: an icon that shows that the user can open and close them
